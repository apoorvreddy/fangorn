= Fangorn Installation Guide =

== Requirements ==
  * Java 5 and above
  * Preferably more than 1 GB RAM
  * Apache Ant (if compiling from source)

== Installing from binaries ==

  # Download one of the archived binaries provided in the Downloads page
  # Decompress the archive
  # To start the app run the following command in the project's main directory
    ** $ sh start-app.sh
  # Point a browser to http://localhost:9090 to view the search page  

== Installing from source ==

  # Checkout the source code (lets call the checkout out directory PROJECT_ROOT)
  # Build the software by running ant from PROJECT_ROOT:
    ** $ cd PROJECT_ROOT
    ** $ ant dist
  # If the build is successful, the above command will create a 'fangorn' folder in the 'PROJECT_ROOT/dist' directory
  # Change to the fangorn dist directory:
    ** $ cd PROJECT_ROOT/dist/fangorn
    ** Note that you can copy the PROJECT_ROOT/dist/fangorn directory to any other directory on your computer and run the app from there
  # Start the app by running the following command in PROJECT_ROOT/dist/fangorn 
    ** $ sh start-app.sh
  # Point a browser to http://localhost:9090 to view the search page 
  
== Adding and removing corpora ==

  * There are two files in the same directory as start-app.sh which support the addition and deletion of corpora
  * create-index-GZ.sh indexes gzipped corpora
  * create-index-MRG.sh indexes corpora formatted as plain text files with the extension .mrg 

Further details on how to use fangorn are available in the README file.
